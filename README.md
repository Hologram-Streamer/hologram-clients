## What is hologram

Hologram is a reimagining of the standard streaming platforms like Parsec or Teamviewing. Rather than needing a lot of setup, logins and registrations hologram will be focused on giving the best possible streaming experience in the smallest amount of time. Meaning the moment where you need a streaming service of some kind hologram will be there for you. Hologram is going to be available in browsers as well as applications, whereas the applications are going to offer more services and the browser are just a faster way to get into a stream.

## Open source
This project is going to be open sourced.
